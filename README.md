# Data Science and Machine Learning Mini Tasks

## About This Repository

Welcome to my collection of data science and machine learning tasks. 
This repository contains a series of single-notebook solutions to various data-related problems.

## Overview

These tasks represent a range of data analysis and machine learning exercises, typically completed within a single Jupyter notebook. 
Some of these may be derived from interview challenges I've encountered, while others are practice exercises or small personal projects.

Key points about this collection:

- Each notebook focuses on a specific data analysis or machine learning task
- Tasks vary in complexity but are generally designed to be concise and focused
- The solutions demonstrate my approach to data problems and coding style
- Data used is either synthetic, from public datasets, or modified to ensure privacy

Feel free to explore the notebooks. If you have any questions about the approaches used or would like to discuss any of the tasks, please don't hesitate to reach out!

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bab-git/data-science-interviews.git
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash 
python -m venv .env
souce .env/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required packages:
Using Python v3.12.0:
```bash
pyenv version 3.12.0
pip install -r requirements_strict.txt
```
Note: If you are using another version of Python, the above dependency versions may fail to install. 
In that case, you can use the flexible version below. But then you may need to adjust the notebook code where you find a syntax error.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Navigate to a specific project folder and open the Jupyter notebook:
```bash
cd tasks/task_name
jupyter notebook task_name_solution.ipynb
```

## Tasks List:
1. [Predict Advertisement Response](tasks/Predict_Advertisement_Response/ads_task.ipynb) - A supervised model to predict the response of residents to direct mailing advertisements.
2. [Predictive Modeling for Material Strength](tasks/Predictive_Modeling_for_Material_Strength/DS_task_final.ipynb) - a regression-based predictive model to estimate the material strength.
3. [Other tasks will be added soon]
